# Plants_Detection-YOLOv8
Plants are essential for human survival and have been used for centuries to treat diseases. In ancient India, people used herbal remedies to cure many ailments. However, our ancestral knowledge of herbal remedies diminished over time as we ignored these powerful gifts from Mother Nature. The goal is to provide basic information about regional plants in our surroundings through plant detection and historical data generation. In the present day, plant detection is error-prone because it is done manually by identifying a plant's physical characteristics, such as its leaves, flowers, and fruits. Considering this notion, I want to use Artificial intelligence to detect plants more accurately and to retrieve information about their medicinal properties and historical data that helps gain knowledge and make informed decisions about their use. This project has the potential to revolutionize herbal medicine and the way we interact with the world around us, making it more accessible and affordable to people across the globe.
